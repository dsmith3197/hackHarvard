Leap Motion project created at HackHarvard  

This python script allows a computer user who suffers from hand tremors to more effectively navigate a computer than with a traditional mouse.

The way it works is that the leap motion tracks the position of the user's hand above the device.  When the hand is in a fist, which is when hand tremors are the least intrusive, the mouse on the screen follows the hand.  When the user opens his/her hand with all fingers, the mouse stops moving and left clicks.  Opening the hand with three fingers is a right click.
